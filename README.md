## FizzBuzz

**You must build befure you can run**. Before anything, run:

```
npm run build
```

...Then, to demonstrate classic FizzBuzz, do:

```
npm run fizzbuzz
```

To impose your own upper bound, simply pass it after the above. For example:

```
npm run fizzbuzz 17
```

...Will run FizzBuzz up to 17 instead of 100.
