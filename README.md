## FizzBuzz

**You must build befure you can run**. Before anything, run:

```
npm run build
```

If you get an error, it's because you're on Windows. Manually `mkdir bin`, then re-run the above. After that, you're good to go. 

To demonstrate classic FizzBuzz, do:

```
npm run fizzbuzz
```

To impose your own upper bound, simply pass it after the above. For example:

```
npm run fizzbuzz 17
```

...Will run FizzBuzz up to 17 instead of 100.
